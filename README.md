# An antigenic atlas of HIV-1 escape from broadly neutralizing antibodies
### Adam S. Dingens,  Dana Arenz, Haidyn Weight, Julie Overbaugh, and Jesse D. Bloom

We are performing mutational antigenic profiling of a panel of bnAbs using the BG505.T332N mutant Env libraries, first described and characterized in [Haddox, Dingens et al 2018](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34420). The triplicate mutant libraries examined here correspond to the three BG505 replicates in this paper. Replicates annotated with an additional letter (i.e. "rep 1b") were done on an independent day and have their own mock selected control. 

The _fraction surviving_ statistic used in this analysis is explained in detail [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/fracsurvive.html), and the computation of `differential selection` (computed here but not discussed in the paper) is described [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/diffsel.html). The barcoded subamplicon Illumina sequencing approach is described in detail [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html).
Our first mutational antigenic profiling analysis of escape from PGT151 using the BF520 env libraries was published [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.05.003) in June 2017, and this original analysis is located [in this ipython notebook](https://github.com/adingens/BF520_MutationalAntigenicProfiling_PGT151).

We use [dms_tools2](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/) to analyze these data. This notebook processes the Illumina deep sequencing data software package, and then analyzes the selection in the context of the antibody. Experiments and analysis performed by Adam Dingens in the [Bloom lab](http://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) in 2017-2018. 


## Organization
The mutational antigenic profiling analysis is performed by the iPython notebook [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb). 

Subdirectories:

   * `./results/` is generated by [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb). It contains the `codoncounts` and `fraction surviving` data and raw output for all figures.
   
   * `./results/FASTQ_files/` contains the input Illumina deep sequencing data. This file is generated by [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb), which downloads the sequencing files from the [Sequence Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

   * `./data/` contains all input data needed to run [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb)). Files are described in the iPython notebok when used. 


## Results and Conclusions
All of the results are breifly detailed in the [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb) notebook; click on this notebook to see the results.
